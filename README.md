## Features

### Core Tournament
- ✅ **Smart Scheduling** — Mathematically optimal "Whist" schedules for 8, 12, and 16 players
- ✅ **Court Rotation** — Algorithm ensures players rotate across different courts each round
- ✅ **Custom Court Names** — Label courts (e.g., "Center Court", "Court A") for easy callouts
- ✅ **Live Scoring** — Enter scores per round, see leaderboard update in real-time
- ✅ **Winner Highlighting** — Completed matches show winning team in green

### Flexible Tournament Management
- ✅ **Add Rounds On-Demand** — "+" button to extend tournament with fair player rotation
- ✅ **Championship Round** — Create finals: 1st+3rd vs 2nd+4th place
- ✅ **Championship Results** — Shows winning team, runner-up, and individual rankings
- ✅ **Locked Setup** — Players locked once tournament starts (prevents accidents)

### Sharing & Cloud Sync
- ✅ **Shareable Links** — Share your tournament with spectators via unique URL
- ✅ **Real-time Sync** — Scores sync to cloud, viewers see updates automatically
- ✅ **Read-only Viewing** — Spectators can view rounds and scores without editing
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup** — Shared tournaments expire after 24 hours

### AI-Powered Features
- ✅ **AI Nicknames** — Generate fun padel-themed nicknames for players (powered by Anthropic Claude)
- ✅ **Optional** — Checkbox to enable/disable nickname generation

### User Experience
- ✅ **Mobile-First** — Responsive design works great on phones at the courts
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation** — Arrow keys to navigate between rounds
- ✅ **Offline Ready** — All data persists in localStorage, no account needed
- ✅ **Tie-Breaking** — Sorted by total points → match wins → point differential

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

### Tournament Flow

1. **Setup** — Add players (4+ required, 8/12/16 for "perfect" balance)
2. **Configure Courts** — Rename courts for your venue (Tab between inputs)
3. **Generate** — Creates all rounds with optimal pairings
4. **Play** — Navigate through rounds, enter scores after each match
5. **Extend** — Add more rounds with "+" button if time permits
6. **Finals** — Create championship round from leaderboard
7. **Results** — See team champions and individual rankings

### Scheduling Algorithm

The app uses **Whist Tournament** logic:

| Players | Rounds | Courts | Balance |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 8 | 7 | 2 | Partner everyone once, oppose everyone twice |
| 12 | 11 | 3 | Partner everyone once, oppose everyone twice |
| 16 | 15 | 4 | Partner everyone once, oppose everyone twice |
| Other | N-1 | Varies | Berger table rotation (partner everyone once) |

**Court Rotation**: Players automatically rotate between courts each round — the algorithm tracks court history and optimizes assignments.

**Additional Rounds**: When adding rounds on-demand, the algorithm:
- Prioritizes players who've played fewer matches
- Avoids recent partner/opponent pairings
- Handles byes for odd player counts
